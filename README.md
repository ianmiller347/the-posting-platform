# The Posting Platform

Create your own platform for user generated content by using this package. You can clone it and it modify it, or use the provided CLI.

You can input certain params to tell the script how to generate your package. It will randomly generate some configs for you, so your site is fairly unique every time you run the generation script. You can input some params to describe how your platform should look, and it will set a few different things accordingly.

## How to use

Requirements include yarn and node. You need at least node 18.

You can run these scripts to get all the functionality of this platform. For now, you pull this repo and run its scripts, which clone necessary boilerplate to your package. Then, you run the platform-setup script to customize your app.

You have the freedom of creating your own next app, rather than this platform dictating some out of date version.

```
npx create-next-app my-new-app --typescript
cd my-new-app
rm -rf pages
git clone https://github.com/ianmiller347/the-posting-platform.git
cd the-posting-platform
yarn run setup-script
```

Now your necessary files have been copied over. Next let's install dependencies.

```
# go back to your app root
cd ../
# run the install script from your app root
node the-posting-platform/installDependencies.js
```

Great now let's setup your platform

```
node platformSetup.js
```

Answer the questions to populate necessary variables to power your app.

That's it!

Now you can delete the posting platform directory

```
rm -rf the-posting-platform
```

## Roadmap

- Create .env on build, inject params based on input
- Allow input for AWS region
- Allow input for alternative post/object-types aside from Users and Posts and generate CRUD methods from them
- Allow input for alternative DDB table names or prefixes

> Alternative recommended
> Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which supports the AWS Toolkit enabling authentication through IAM Identity Center.

## Developing locally

Run `yarn install` to get the dependencies installed.

You need an AWS account with a table named "Users" and a table named "Posts".

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Setting your IDE to work with this project

If you use VSCode, it's a good idea to have this in your settings.json:

```
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
},
"eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "typescript",
    "typescriptreact"
],
```

For tailwind, visit [their docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup) on setting up your editor to stop complaining.
In VSCode, open the settings, search for 'unknown', the first result should be the one youâ€™re looking for: CSS > Lint: Unknown At Rules. Set it to 'ignore'.

### Coding style

For React components, use TitleCaseNaming both in the filename and for the component itself. The folder it lives in should have the same name and it should have an index.ts file which exports the MyComponentName file's default export.

For CSS, use BEM syntax and dash-casing for classnames. Don't use camelCasing in CSS at all.
